# What is Cryptocurrency?
### How does it work?

### Introduction

A cryptocurrency is a digital currency in which encryption techniques regulate generation of currency and verify the transfer of funds operating independent of a central service. 

A cryptocurrency usually consists of three main parts:

  - Blockchain
    - A large immutable linked list that stores all previous transactions, analagous to a bank ledger
  
  - Wallet
    - Software to allow the storage and sending of cryptocurrency
  
  - Network
    - Decentralized node graph around the world supporting the cryptocurrency
  
There are multiple different types of cryptocurrency with different implementations and usages. For example:

  - Functional Currencies
    - Currencies that act like software
      - Etherium, OMG
      
  - Proof of Work
    - Currencies that require a large amount of work to verify transactions
      - Bitcoin, Monero
      
  - Proof of Stake
    - Currencies that require a large amount of holding at stake to verify transactions
      - NEO, OMNI

Why was cryptocurrency created?

  - An experiment by Satoshi Nakamoto to put in place a decentralized currency
  
  - To be a currency with limitless scalability
