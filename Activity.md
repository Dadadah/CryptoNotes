# Cryptonotes Activity

We're going to give you a base ledger. The accounts will initially be defined as follows:

  - 1: 1 coin
  
  - 2: 3 coins
  
  - 3: 15 coins
  
  - 4: 10 coins
  
  - 5: 20 coins
  
#### No account is allowed to have a negative balance

Break into groups. 

After the activity we will show what the ledger is ***supposed*** to be.

[Next we will cover blockchain technology in cryptocurrency](https://github.com/Dadadah/CryptoNotes/blob/master/Blockchain.md)
